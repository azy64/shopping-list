      To you, my love, I dedicate this application, an extraordinary woman, with a strong and fulfilled mind, generous and radiant, to you who shines brightly and has a loving heart that gives itself entirely to love. I couldn't have dreamed of anything better for my life or for our future children. I am grateful to heaven for putting you on my path, a path that seemed devoid of presence. However, like a game-changing ingredient in the midst of scattered soups, heaven decided to put you in mine to change its flavor, equaling that of illustrious chefs. You are a support, a gazelle with a startled air, yet you hide a profound beauty that one could not suspect and an intelligence worthy of the great minds of our century with a touch of dark humor that is sarcastic and funny. I love you with an infinite and ineffable love, a love that has transcended time and space, that has hardened through trials unsuspected by all. Only God knows this, and it is a love that I intend to share with you, until eternal life.
